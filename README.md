# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

### Objectives:

The goal of this project was to implement the Singleton Pattern for managing bank branches in JavaScript. By using the Singleton Pattern, we ensure that only one instance of the BankBranch class is created throughout the application, preventing multiple instances from being created and ensuring that all instances refer to the same object.

### Reflections:

In this project, the Singleton Pattern was implemented to create a robust solution for managing bank branches. The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of the BankBranch class exists, providing a centralized point of access to branch information throughout the application. This design pattern helps in simplifying the management of branch data and prevents potential issues that could arise from multiple instances of the class.


### Challenge faced:

Understanding the Singleton pattern was a nit of a challenge until I did some research to really understand the purpose of this project. Asking my peers who understtod better also helped me understand this method better.

### Areas for Improvement:

Practicing Javascript and learning new ways to code.

### Overall learning experience:

Creating the Singleton Pattern to manage bank branches taught me a lot about design patterns and how JavaScript works. It helped me understand how to use the Singleton Pattern to make software better. I learned why design patterns are important for making code that's easy to maintain. I also  picked up useful ways to handle data and keep it consistent in JavaScript programs.
